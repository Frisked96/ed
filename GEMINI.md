# Gemini CLI Project Map

- `main.py`: Entry point; initializes Pygame, the renderer, and the state-driven application flow.
- `core.py`: Defines core data structures like `Map`, `EditorSession`, `ToolState`, and the `UndoStack`.
- `editor_state.py`: Manages the primary editor UI, viewport logic, tool interactions, and event handling.
- `state_engine.py`: A generic state machine and stack-based manager for handling application states and UI layers.
- `view.py`: Handles high-performance map rendering using chunk-based caching and procedural glyph generation.
- `flow.py`: A high-level state controller that manages transitions between menus, wizards, and the editor.
- `controller.py`: Dispatches input events (keys/mouse) to functional actions based on configurable bindings.
- `drawing.py`: Implements geometric drawing algorithms (lines, rects, circles) and tile placement logic.
- `map_io.py`: Handles file system operations for loading/saving maps, configurations, and macros.
- `tiles.py`: Manages the `REGISTRY` of tile definitions, their characters, colors, and metadata.
- `utils.py`: Contains shared utility functions for math, coordinate conversion, and distance calculations.
- `signals.py`: Provides a simple observer pattern for decoupled event notifications across modules.
- `actions/`: Directory containing modular handlers for specific editor features (file ops, drawing, macros, etc.).
- `menu/`: Directory containing UI state implementations for menus, pickers, and modal dialogs.
- `rogue/`: (Placeholder or sub-module) Likely intended for specific roguelike logic or game-specific extensions.
- `colors.json`: External configuration for standardizing color names to RGB values.
- `theme.json`: Configuration for the Pygame GUI visual style and appearance.
- `custom_tiles.json`: Persistent storage for user-defined tile types.
- `macros.json`: Persistent storage for recorded relative-tile macros.
- `map_editor_config.json`: Stores user preferences and custom key/mouse input bindings.
